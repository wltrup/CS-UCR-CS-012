# UC Riverside CS-012 Handouts

In 2003, I was a lecturer in the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering** of the **University of California, Riverside, USA**. While teaching **Introduction to Computer Programming (CS-012)**, I wrote two handouts that the students found useful: 

[A Brief Introduction to Computer Organization](https://github.com/wltrup/CS-UCR-CS-012/blob/main/Intro_Comp_Org.pdf)

[A Brief Introduction To Stacks And
Function Activation Frames](https://github.com/wltrup/CS-UCR-CS-012/blob/main/Stack_Frames.pdf)
